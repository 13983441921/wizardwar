Setup and Compiling
===================

### Sprite Textures

Run `make` to compile the images in the spritesheet directories into spritesheets. This requires TexturePacker pro and the command line tools installed. If you only have the free version, open the .tps files and hit publish. 

### Dependencies

1. Install http://cocoapods.org/
2. `pod install`
3. Use WizardWar.xcworkspace to run the project

SPELL IDEAS
===========


SUMMON DEATH: 
  - slow monster who marches out and kills the first living thing he touches
  - counter: monster
  - save as a special? ... might be too hard to counter then. 

TORNADO: 
  - knocks altitude things to the ground
  - fast enough to actually hit
  - does damage if player is levitated

VORTEX
  - sucks things into the middle of the screen. For each thing it sucks in, it gets bigger, until it sucks both players in.
  - depends on the side it is on
  - moves forward. When it hits something / anything, it gets bigger. 
  - gets smaller over time. Won't actually reach them at first. Has to absorb stuff
  - slow moving?

  - if it hits you, it sucks you in and you die. all the way? Seems extreme :) 
  - damages you based on its size I guess. More fun if it sucks you in though. 
  - it has gravity. Sucks things towards it, including players. 

WIND BLAST:
  - slows things down depending on their mass / interaction.
  - pops bubble
  - or speeds things up if in the same direction
  - can't reverse anything's direction though?

ROCKET
  - it sits in front of you
  - hit with fire, it takes off. Altitude
  - it goes a certain distance and loses altitude
  - then it crashes and explodes
