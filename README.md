BUGS
- pulls you out of a game if you are in one already


HEAL: you cast it an you begin to heal slowly until you do something else. 
  - make him glow red with code or something

SLEEP: If hit they fall asleep? Or is it automatic?  How would you defend against it if it doesn't shoot out? 
  - invisible
  - will sleep any animal
  - need green bolt.

LEVITATE: (effect)
  - you go up one alititude
  - after a bit you go back down. Or cast another effect. 
  - some spells sink: monster, walls, vine
  - others just won't hit

SUMMON DEATH: 
  - slow monster who marches out and kills the first living thing he touches
  - counter: monster
  - save as a special? ... might be too hard to counter then. 

TORNADO: 
  - knocks altitude things to the ground
  - fast enough to actually hit
  - does damage if player is levitated

VORTEX
  - sucks things into the middle of the screen. For each thing it sucks in, it gets bigger, until it sucks both players in.
  - depends on the side it is on
  - moves forward. When it hits something / anything, it gets bigger. 
  - gets smaller over time. Won't actually reach them at first. Has to absorb stuff
  - slow moving?

  - if it hits you, it sucks you in and you die. all the way? Seems extreme :) 
  - damages you based on its size I guess. More fun if it sucks you in though. 
  - it has gravity. Sucks things towards it, including players. 

WIND BLAST:
  - slows things down depending on their mass / interaction.
  - pops bubble
  - or speeds things up if in the same direction
  - can't reverse anything's direction though?

ROCKET
  - it sits in front of you
  - hit with fire, it takes off. Altitude
  - it goes a certain distance and loses altitude
  - then it crashes and explodes
