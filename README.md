STUFF TO DO
===========

[x] Smooth animation: use updates to move them, instead of tween
[ ] BUG: crash you experienced while playing
[ ] New mana/spam
[ ] Feedback: if they don't cast a spell within a certain time, tell them what to do
[ ] Add random "fail" spells (with two elements) any 2 elements triggers a random fail spell

[ ] TALK: Trevor: plans for app? Moving forward plan? What do we do? Money?
[ ] TALK: Jesse: fail spells. Other 2 spells. 

[ ] Improve Practice Mode AI?
[ ] Improve Wind Blast interaction

IDEA: we can have some spells take "more mana", meaning they reduce the size of the indicators used MORE

[x] Make walls and monsters fall
[x] More spells. Fill it up!

BUGS
- pulls you out of a game if you are in one already






SPELL IDEAS
===========


SUMMON DEATH: 
  - slow monster who marches out and kills the first living thing he touches
  - counter: monster
  - save as a special? ... might be too hard to counter then. 

TORNADO: 
  - knocks altitude things to the ground
  - fast enough to actually hit
  - does damage if player is levitated

VORTEX
  - sucks things into the middle of the screen. For each thing it sucks in, it gets bigger, until it sucks both players in.
  - depends on the side it is on
  - moves forward. When it hits something / anything, it gets bigger. 
  - gets smaller over time. Won't actually reach them at first. Has to absorb stuff
  - slow moving?

  - if it hits you, it sucks you in and you die. all the way? Seems extreme :) 
  - damages you based on its size I guess. More fun if it sucks you in though. 
  - it has gravity. Sucks things towards it, including players. 

WIND BLAST:
  - slows things down depending on their mass / interaction.
  - pops bubble
  - or speeds things up if in the same direction
  - can't reverse anything's direction though?

ROCKET
  - it sits in front of you
  - hit with fire, it takes off. Altitude
  - it goes a certain distance and loses altitude
  - then it crashes and explodes
